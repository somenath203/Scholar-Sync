## üìù **Note**  

If while generating a roadmap or the top 10 QnAs, you encounter an error like:  

> An error occurred while fetching the roadmap or the LLM model was unable to generate the Roadmap correctly. Please go back, refresh the page, and try creating a new one.  

One common reason for this issue is that the response generated by the LLM model cannot be converted into JSON format to display it. In such case:  

1. Go back to the previous page.  
2. Refresh the page.  
3. Try creating a new roadmap or QnA again.
